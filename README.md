# Welcome to miKitchen!

miKitchen is a unique and engaging data visualization project that allows users to explore and interact with a 2D representation of a kitchen. In this interactive kitchen, users can click on different parts of the kitchen, and each piece of furniture or appliance serves a specific function or provides valuable information. Whether you're a cooking enthusiast, a nutrition-conscious individual, or simply curious, this project is designed to offer a fun and informative experience. The primary purpose of this project is to create an interactive kitchen environment that not only engages users but also educates them about cooking, nutrition, and the relationship between ingredients and recipes. By allowing users to interact with various kitchen elements, the project aims to provide an immersive learning experience that combines practical kitchen tasks with informative data visualization.
